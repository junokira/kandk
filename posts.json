It’s a strategy that not only strengthens brand identity but also builds a community that feels seen, heard, and celebrated.</p>\n\n<p>In a landscape where global sportswear giants often play it safe, Puma’s willingness to share the stage — and let new voices lead the narrative — might just be its most powerful move yet.</p>"

With co-signs and collaborations alongside <strong>Travis Scott, Wizkid, Gunna</strong> and more, she’s clearly here for the long run.</p>\n\n<p>But with fame comes scrutiny. In the U.S. — particularly within the Black American community — Tyla’s identity has been questioned. By publicly aligning herself with the <em>Coloured community</em>, a South African ethnic group with mixed heritage rooted in European, African, and Asian ancestry, she has faced criticism for not identifying as Black.</p>\n\n<p>This cultural debate has shaped how her music is perceived. Some have been quick to label her latest project a “flop.” But here’s the twist: the so-called “album” in question is actually <strong>WWP</strong>, a <em>four-track EP</em> featuring just two singles (<strong>“Bliss”</strong> and <strong>“Is It”</strong>). So — EPs are albums now? Even if we play along and call it one, the numbers tell a different story.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, <em>WWP</em> sold only <strong>3,700 units</strong> in the U.S. — modest by old-school standards. Yet on streaming platforms, the project is thriving: over <strong>60 million Spotify streams</strong> to date, with nearly <strong>12 million in its first week</strong>. The standout single <strong>“Dynamite” (feat. Wizkid)</strong> scored the <em>highest debut of the year</em> on the <strong>Billboard U.S. Afrobeats chart</strong>, while critics backed the music too — <strong>NME</strong> rated the EP <strong>4/5</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So, did Tyla flop? Not even close. <em>WWP</em> may be short and playful, but it’s backed by streams, charts, and cultural impact — proving Tyla’s momentum is only getting stronger.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The CFDA has announced that animal fur will be banned from New York Fashion Week collections starting September 2026. The policy applies to all shows on the Official NYFW Schedule and extends across the CFDA’s Fashion Calendar, website, and social media platforms.</p>\n\n<p>The ban covers fur sourced from animals raised or trapped specifically for their pelts, including mink, fox, rabbit, chinchilla, coyote, and raccoon dog, with an exemption for fur obtained by Indigenous communities through traditional subsistence hunting.</p>\n\n<p>The move aligns NYFW with other global fashion weeks such as London, Copenhagen, and Berlin, and reflects a broader industry shift toward more ethical and innovative material practices. The CFDA will support designers through the transition by offering educational resources and alternative material options.</p>"
