By allowing collaborators to bring their own DNA into projects, Puma sidesteps the cookie-cutter approach and instead delivers collections that feel relevant, experimental, and culturally plugged-in.</p>\n\n<p>This commitment to collaboration has paid off: from limited-edition drops with underground creatives to reimagining archival pieces with fresh perspectives, Puma has kept its output unpredictable yet authentic. It’s a strategy that not only strengthens brand identity but also builds a community that feels seen, heard, and celebrated.</p>\n\n<p>In a landscape where global sportswear giants often play it safe, Puma’s willingness to share the stage — and let new voices lead the narrative — might just be its most powerful move yet.</p>"

With co-signs and collaborations alongside <strong>Travis Scott, Wizkid, Gunna</strong> and more, she’s clearly here for the long run.</p>\n\n<p>But with fame comes scrutiny. In the U.S. — particularly within the Black American community — Tyla’s identity has been questioned. By publicly aligning herself with the <em>Coloured community</em>, a South African ethnic group with mixed heritage rooted in European, African, and Asian ancestry, she has faced criticism for not identifying as Black.</p>\n\n<p>This cultural debate has shaped how her music is perceived. Some have been quick to label her latest project a “flop.” But here’s the twist: the so-called “album” in question is actually <strong>WWP</strong>, a <em>four-track EP</em> featuring just two singles (<strong>“Bliss”</strong> and <strong>“Is It”</strong>). So — EPs are albums now? Even if we play along and call it one, the numbers tell a different story.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, <em>WWP</em> sold only <strong>3,700 units</strong> in the U.S. — modest by old-school standards. Yet on streaming platforms, the project is thriving: over <strong>60 million Spotify streams</strong> to date, with nearly <strong>12 million in its first week</strong>. The standout single <strong>“Dynamite” (feat. Wizkid)</strong> scored the <em>highest debut of the year</em> on the <strong>Billboard U.S. Afrobeats chart</strong>, while critics backed the music too — <strong>NME</strong> rated the EP <strong>4/5</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So, did Tyla flop? Not even close. <em>WWP</em> may be short and playful, but it’s backed by streams, charts, and cultural impact — proving Tyla’s momentum is only getting stronger.</p>",
