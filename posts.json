In the U.S. ‚Äî particularly within the Black American community ‚Äî Tyla‚Äôs identity has been questioned. By publicly aligning herself with the <em>Coloured community</em>, a South African ethnic group with mixed heritage rooted in European, African, and Asian ancestry, she has faced criticism for not identifying as Black.</p>\n\n<p>This cultural debate has shaped how her music is perceived. Some have been quick to label her latest project a ‚Äúflop.‚Äù But here‚Äôs the twist: the so-called ‚Äúalbum‚Äù in question is actually <strong>WWP</strong>, a <em>four-track EP</em> featuring just two singles (<strong>‚ÄúBliss‚Äù</strong> and <strong>‚ÄúIs It‚Äù</strong>). So ‚Äî EPs are albums now? Even if we play along and call it one, the numbers tell a different story.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, <em>WWP</em> sold only <strong>3,700 units</strong> in the U.S. ‚Äî modest by old-school standards. Yet on streaming platforms, the project is thriving: over <strong>60 million Spotify streams</strong> to date, with nearly <strong>12 million in its first week</strong>. The standout single <strong>‚ÄúDynamite‚Äù (feat. Wizkid)</strong> scored the <em>highest debut of the year</em> on the <strong>Billboard U.S. Afrobeats chart</strong>, while critics backed the music too ‚Äî <strong>NME</strong> rated the EP <strong>4/5</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So, did Tyla flop?
